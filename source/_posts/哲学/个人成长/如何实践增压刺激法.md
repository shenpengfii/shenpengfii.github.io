If you suddenly have an opportunity to engage in a business at its ascending stage, where this chance is also left open to many others, then access to the business has to become more and more difficult along the time. To seize such rare moment, you must strive to perform better than anyone else after the same period of preparation, and undertake the dangers and results of competation failure. As a result, one's success relies on not only opportunities, but also ambitious self-requirements, effective utilization of time, and accurate self-positioning.

机会越大，风险越大。如果哪项事业正处在它的增长阶段，那么这项事业的准入门槛也一定会越来越严苛。要想抓住这个罕见的机遇，也就意味着在经过同样的学习空窗期后，你必须比其他人表现得更加出色，还得承担竞争失败的风险与后果。因此，一个人的成功离不开对时间的高效利用，也更离不开对自我的准确定位和严格要求。
